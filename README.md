# VGCore

## To-Do List :

VGCore:
- Authentication (Data saved encrypted online on my data server)
- Chat Filter (Records Multiple chat filter abuses and sends data to my data server) [**Done**]
- Store System for Real Money Transfers (GUI) (Recommended to not have any in-game perks giving advantage as it violates EULA of Mojang)
- Store System for In Game Items (UI)
- Faction World Random Transportation
- Faction Mines (mines can be in caves that reset so it's like a prison? Cool idea?)
- Enchantments (Enchantments can be bought from a merchant with in-game gold you get from selling items? Or just randomly through enchantment table)
- Cosmetics
- Settings Tab and In-game Images in server
- Staff System (done via UI) to time ban specific users. (Data for bans and other systems collected on my data server, data is encrypted)
- 128-bit Encryption Protocol making server nearly unhackable. 
- USER Balancing System to ensure server being as smooth as possible.
- Ranks System (allowing cosmetics)
